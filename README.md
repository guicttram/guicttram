I'm not a big fan of those fancy Github profiles with colorful and moving READMEs. Big fan of Databricks though.

Also, I know my profile pic looks like it's made with AI, but I assure you it's the photographer's fault.

Finally, I haven't done many personal projects since I graduated. And I don't plan to.
